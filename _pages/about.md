# üßë‚Äçüéì About Me
+ <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="40px"></h1> Hi, I am **Zhidi Lin (ÊûóÂøóÂú∞)**, currently a Ph.D. student at the [School of Science and Engineering (SSE)](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), under the supervision of [Prof. Feng Yin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4mW1N5oAAAAJ&hl=en) (main-supervisor) and [Prof. Shuguang Cui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1o_qvR0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (co-supervisor). Prior to my Ph.D. studies, I received my M.Sc. degree from [Xiamen University](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/) in 2019, under the supervision of Prof. Qi Yang and [Prof. Xuemin Hong](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xuemin-Hong). From Aug. 2017 to Mar. 2019, I was a research intern at [Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data](http://www.sribd.cn/en) (SRIBD), working with [Prof. Dongliang Duan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OEDs9p8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Liuqing Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dmOGdOYAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests include data-driven modelling, Bayesian learning and inference, Gaussian process, and the related applications.
+ My research interests include Network Security, Wireless Sensing, Signal Processing, as well as the Machine Learning Methods.

[Identify Selective Forwarding Attacks Using Danger Model: Promote the Detection Accuracy in Wireless Sensor Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9755128)

**Xinyu Huang**, Yuanming Wu

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=cuDwCOwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=cuDwCOwAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='cuDwCOwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN'></span></strong>
- We proposed a multi-level detection scheme inspired by human immune system against selective forwarding attacks in WSNs. 
- The detection accuracy and the false alarm rate are much lower than other effective methods.
- We also reduced the computation complexity to $$O(n)$$.
